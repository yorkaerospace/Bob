 - JLC PCB accepts revisions if you contact customer support *quickly*.
 - Ensure breakout pins are aligned to a 0.1" grid.
 - Ensure USB traces are correctly sized to get the correct impedance.
 	- This involves a lot of maths. Use [a calculator.](https://www.pcbway.com/pcb_prototype/impedance_calculator.html)

 - Screw switch has large thermal mass, so it needs to be soldered first.
 	 - It is also large, so the nut should be located *far* away from other components so you can actually solder them.
 	 - Eggtimer uses a brass nut, but I was able to get it to work with random M3s I found lying around.
 		 - Chromed or galved nuts *don't* work.
 	 - Needs to have some form of shake-prevention, e.g. nylock or shakeproof washer.
 	 - JLC fills hole with copper, which needs to be filed out.
 	 - M2 is probably more reasonable. 
 	 - Aside from this, seems to work well as a detail.
 - 0603's are the absolute smallest that can be soldered with "normal" soldering supplies.
 	 - 0806 is probably more reasonable.
 	 - 0402 is *pain*.
 - Hot air and flux make everything *so much* easier.
 	 - Fluid tension pulls components into alignment in a *very* satisfying way.
 	 - Flux doesn't hold QFNs that well, but heating the board and dropping the package on seems to work.
 	 - Leaving flux on the board too long can tarnish the pads. 
 	 	 - May affect reliability.
 	 	 - Is ugly as sin.
 	 	 - Pads can still be tinned, but the easiest solution is to *not let it happen*.
 	 	 - Clean board with IPA and and old toothbrush.
 	 - 0402s have a nasty tendency to tombstone.
 - 5032 crystals are hard to find. 
 - Placing tight arrays of components is difficult.
 - JLC have an assembly option.

 - LED does not need to be nearly that bright. Use a 220R current limiter.
 - Buy the *right* size of component, you moron.
 - 0.5 mm text is too small, 0.75-1 is probably more reasonable
 - Thermal relief will make soldering things to GND so much easier.
 - Buzzer is not very loud, maybe run it off VBAT?
 - Its perfectly safe to use a button on BOOTSEL.
